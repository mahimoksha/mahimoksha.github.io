I am Mokshagna Sai Teja Karanam studying master's in computer science at [University of Utah, Utah](https://www.utah.edu/) in [School of Computing](https://www.cs.utah.edu/). Currently, I'm in [Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute](https://www.sci.utah.edu/) under the guidance of [Prof. Shireen Elhabian](https://www.sci.utah.edu/~shireen/).



Research Interests
------
With a focus on innovative research, Currently, I'm working on advanced Machine Learning/deep learning methods to analyze and quantify medical images. My research interests also include Computer Vision, Image Processing and Probabilistic Machine Learning. I'm interested in developing advanced algorithms and techniques in **Medical Imaging** through the utilization of deep learning. My focus also lies in  **Statistical Shape Modeling**. Specifically I’m interested in the leveraging concepts of self-supervised learning, MultiModal Learning, Adversarial Training, Domain Adaptation, Diffusion Models and the challenges posed by limited data and the intricacies of solving Regression tasks. The ultimate objective is to develop methodologies and algorithms capable of comprehending semantic information across various modalities and tasks. The idea of tackling intricate data challenges in the industry is exciting to me and inspires me to collaborate with organizations that can help me enhance my skills and knowledge.

Education
======
* B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering, B V Raju Institute of Technology, 2016-2020
* M.S. in Computer Science, University of Utah, 2022-2024
* Ph.D in Computer Science, University of Utah, 2024-2029 (expected)

Work experience
======
* Scientific Computing and Imaging Institute: Graduate Research Assistant - August 2022 - Current
  * Spearheading an end-to-end preprocessing pipeline for Craniosynostosis data, incorporating segmentation, registration, and bulk upload handling, improving efficiency by 20%.
  * Formulated a transformer-based architecture for unsupervised 3D medical image registration, utilizing high-resolution tokens reducing computational redundancy.
  * Achieved state-of-the-art performance on the OASIS dataset, using 16-27x fewer parameters.
  * Proposed an automated, computationally efficient, and on-the-fly adversarial data augmentation technique tailored for Statistical Shape Modeling and Regression Tasks which reduced approximately 60% training time.
  * Introduced a novel regularization technique utilizing contrastive loss. This technique aimed to generate more task and data-specific samples, leading to a substantial 10% performance enhancement across diverse modalities.
  * Designed ShapeWorks test systems for different modalities and deployed datasets in the shapeworks cloud.
  * Utilized a range of multi-task techniques, including segmentation, distance transforms, and depth estimation, to enhance shape modeling performance by 20%.
  * Conducted experiments with 3 multi-organ anatomies and pretraining strategies to optimize the performance of a single anatomy.

* Tata Consultancy Services: Systems Engineer - November 2020 - July 2022
  * Worked on an application project in AWS using Django Framework.
  * Developed application's ORM layer and deployed an extensive suite of REST APIs.
  * Engineered web services and devised distinct lambda jobs, resulting in service optimization exceeding 25%.
  * Identified and rectified performance bottlenecks, resulting in a notable 50% enhancement in page load speed.
  * Executed over 15 stored procedures and performed operations within MySQL to improve the data retrieval and storage processes.
  * Enforced access controls for 1000-plus users, enhancing systems security and aligning data access privileges accurately.
  * Engaged in roadmap consultations, mentoring and guiding a team of 2
  * Collaborated with cross-functional teams to successfully execute a large-scale migration from Python 2.7 to Python 3.8.
* OpenText: Associate Software Engineer - September 2019 - September 2020
  * Implemented crucial features and user Access Control for the product TeamSite using AngularJS and ReactJS.
* OpenText: Engineering Intern - June 2019 - September 2020
  * Created a Report Generation Tool with Python, enabling real-time monitoring of usage and provides performance metrics for over 100 usecases.

excerpt: 'Anatomy evaluation is crucial for understanding the physiological state, diagnosing abnormalities, and guiding medical interventions. Statistical shape modeling (SSM) is vital in this process, particularly in medical image analysis and computational anatomy. By enabling the extraction of quantitative morphological shape descriptors from medical imaging data such as MRI and CT scans, SSM provides comprehensive descriptions of anatomical variations within a population. However, the effectiveness of SSM in anatomy evaluation hinges on the quality and robustness of the shape models, which face challenges due to substantial nonlinear variability in human anatomy. While deep learning techniques show promise in addressing these challenges by learning complex nonlinear representations of shapes, existing models still have limitations and often require pre-established shape models for training. To overcome these issues, we propose Mesh2SSM++, a novel approach that learns to estimate correspondences from meshes in an unsupervised manner. This method leverages unsupervised, permutation-invariant representation learning to estimate how to deform a template point cloud into subject specific meshes, forming a correspondence based shape model. Additionally, our probabilistic formulation allows learning a population specific template, reducing potential biases associated with template selection. A key feature of Mesh2SSM++ is its ability to quantify aleatoric uncertainty, which captures inherent data variability and is essential for ensuring reliable model predictions and robust decision making in clinical tasks, especially under challenging imaging conditions. Through extensive validation across diverse anatomies, evaluation metrics, and downstream tasks, we demonstrate that Mesh2SSM++ outperforms existing methods. Its ability to operate directly on meshes, combined with computational efficiency and interpretability through its probabilistic framework, makes it an attractive alternative to traditional and deep learning-based SSM approaches.'
